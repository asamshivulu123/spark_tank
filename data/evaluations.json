    "feedbackSummary": "She Ride addresses a deeply critical and substantial unmet need for women's safety in Indian ride-hailing, with an innovative concept that shows strong problem-solution fit. However, the pitch lacked crucial strategic depth and clarity, particularly evident in the Q&A session. The team demonstrated a fundamental gap in understanding or articulating how to acquire and manage essential safety data, recruit a sufficient driver pool, effectively compete with market giants, and handle critical safety incidents. Before moving forward, it is imperative to develop comprehensive, actionable plans for these core operational and risk management challenges to prove feasibility and build investor confidence."
